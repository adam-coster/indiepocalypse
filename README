The author attaches no license to any of the data or code,
it is therefore in the Public Domain.

# THE DATA #
The data is from Steamspy, using the tag-based search tools
followed by the copy-to-clipboard functionality. The header
was modified to be R-parseable. The rest of the data is processed
within the R script.

# THE R SCRIPT #
The R script cleans up the data and then generates a set of
plots. It has several requirements for use: R itself, and the
packages loaded at the top of the script. The author has not
attached any license to this script, so you may download,
redistribute, and edit it as you please.

# CONTACT #
The author has no plans to update the data or code. It is
meant to provide transparency to the companion article at
